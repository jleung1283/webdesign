	<p>Open a New Illustrator Document 800 x 800, 
	
	<p>Open Perspective Grid Tool,
	
	<p>Create Rectangle from Top Middle Corner towards the left until it's about 1/4th of the shown perspective square. 
	
	<p>Try to make it a square, which will let you know when there's a purple line that goes through diagonally. 

	<p>Create another Square from the back right bottom corner so that the Square is parallel to the first one in terms of orientation, and similarly try to make it 1/4th of the imaginary back square. (It should look smaller because of perspective.) 
	
	<p>Lastly, Create one more Square At the Bottom Middle Corner in the same orientation as the other two rectangles so now all three should be facing the same way. 
	
	<p>Have this Square go off of the perspective cube until it's roughly 1/9th of the total square. 

	<p>Now turn off the perspective grid by going to View > Perspective Grid > Hide Grid.
